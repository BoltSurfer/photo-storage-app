# photo-storage-app
In this project, I will use the infrastructure of the GoTally app to create a photo storage app.  
With the app, users can: 
* Open the camera,
* Take a picture
* Store a photo
* Select a file from internal storage and store it where desired
* Use Google's image recognition capabilities to describe the pictures in a funny way
